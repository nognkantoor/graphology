### Sub tasks 


### Integrative Graphology ###

This is the approach of analyzing handwriting, starting at the microscopic level, and ending at the macroscopic level.

#### The Easy Part ####

The starting point is merging the following worksheets into one:
  *  The IGAS Green Sheet;
* IGAS White Sheet
  *  The IGA Yellow Sheet;
  *  The IHU Worksheet;

This will enable one to obtain the raw scores for primary traits.

#### The Hard Part ####

The hardest part of Integrative Graphology evaluation, is determining the presence, and strength of the evaluated traits.  The traits that are brought forth, as a result of the interaction of the primary traits.

#### The Very Hard Part ####

The most ambitious proposal is a tool that reads an image, then constructs the following reports:
  * Basic Scores for each known system of Integrative Graphology;
  * Raw scores for each known system of Holistic Graphology;
  * Physical measurements for each of the 1,500 physically measurable data points of a trizonal letter;

### Holistic Graphology ###

### The Easy Part ####

The simple part is construction of the various worksheets:
  * The Wittlich Character Diagram: Two known variants;
  * The Psychogram: Four known variants;
  * The Psychograph;
  * The Personal Worth Chart;
  * The Muller Enskat Protokol;
