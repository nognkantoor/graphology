== Introduction ==

The four freedoms are:
  * Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
  * Freedom 1: The freedom to study and modify the program.
  * Freedom 2: The freedom to copy the program so you can help your neighbor.
  * Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

There is no generally available software that meets those four criteria.  This projects attempts to remedy that situation.

== Details ==

=== Spreadsheets ===

Open Document Format was chosen for the spreadsheets as it is an ISO standard.  Tools that can utilize this format are freely available.  

These will also be delivered as OpenOffice.org Templates.

=== Databases ===

SQLite was chosen as the database. The primary factors in selecting this database engine are:
  * All tables are combined into one file --- easy transportability of individual databases;
  * Platform independence;
    * It has been ported to a number of operating systems;
    * It has been ported to a number of programming languages;

=== Stand Alone Tools ===

The tools will be written in Python.

=== OOo Extensions ===

Once the bugs have been ironed out of the stand alone tools, they will be rewritten as extensions for OxygenOffice Professional.
