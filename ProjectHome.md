# Aim #

The purpose of this project is to create/provide tools that can do the grunt work involved in analyzing handwriting.

# Tools #

Part 1: Creation of ODF (ISO/IEC 26300:2006 specifications) formatted spreadsheets for Integrative Graphology and Holistic Graphology;

Part II: Construction of SQLite databases, that are functionally equivalent to the ODF spreadsheets;

Part III: Writing a program that will read output from electronic digital calipers, inserting it into an SQLite database;

Part IV: Writing a program that will match the database contents to typologies defined by various systems, such as DISC, Myers-Briggs, Keirsey Temperament Sorter, Thematic Apperception Test, MMPI, MMPI-2, 16PF, etc.

Part V:  Writing a program that will match the database contents to _Dictionary of Occupation Titles_, and related lists, and books on jobs and job requirements;

# Documentation #

Documentation will consist of:

  * How to install the tools on a computer;
  * A list of terms used in the tools, and the definition of those terms;
  * A list of books to study, to use the system of handwriting analysis inherent with the specific tool;
